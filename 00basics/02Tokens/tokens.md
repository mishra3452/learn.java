## Tokens  

The smallest unit of any programing language is called tokens. There are following types of tokens in java :  

  * Identifiers  
  * Keywords  
  * Variables  
  * Literals  
  * Operators  

### Identifiers  

The name of programs, classes, interfaces, mrthods, variables, etc are called Identifiers.  

### Keywords  

In the Java programming language, a keyword is one of 61 reserved words that have a predefined meaning in the language; because of this, programmers cannot use keywords as names for variables, methods, classes, or as any other identifier. Of these 61 keywords, 59 are in use and 2 are not in use. Due to their special functions in the language, most integrated development environments for Java use syntax highlighting to display keywords in a different colour for easy identification.  

For example : int, char, float, null, T, F, etc.

### Variables  

A variable is the name given to a memory location. It is the basic unit of storage in a program.  

  * The value stored in a variable can be changed during program execution.  
  * A variable is only a name given to a memory location, all the operations done on the variable effects that memory location.  
  * In Java, all the variables must be declared before use.  

There are three types of variables in Java:  

  * Local Variables  
  * Instance Variables  
  * Static Variables  

We will learn more about variables in detail.  

### Literals  

Any constant value which can be assigned to the variable is called as literal/constant.  

```java
// Here 100 is a constant/literal.
int x = 100;
```  

Types of literals :  

  * Numeric  
  * Character  
  * Reference  
  * Boolean  

### Operators  

Java provides many types of operators which can be used according to the need. They are classified based on the functionality they provide. Some of the types are :  

  * Arithmetic Operators  
  * Unary Operators  
  * Assignment Operator  
  * Relational Operators  
  * Logical Operators  
  * Ternary Operator  
  * Bitwise Operators  
  * Shift Operators  
  * Instance of operator  
  * Precedence and Associativity  

We will learn more about these in operator section.
