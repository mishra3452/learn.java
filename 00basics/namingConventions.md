## Naming Conventions in Java  

In java we use various naming conventions for classes, interfaces, packagesa, methods, variables, etc.
Don't worry, we  will learn in detail about the above said topics. In this lesson we are more focused on naming conventions.  

Note : These naming conventions are not needed to be strictly followed but if you have a habit of using these naming conventions then it will differentiate you from others.  

### For Classes and Interfaces  

  * Must start with upper case letter.  
  * In mixed case, first letter of each internal word should be capitalised. This convention is called camel case.  
  For example : MountainBike, ImageSprite, String, System, etc.  

### For Packages  

  * Must be written in small letters.  
  For example: java.util.com.Lnct.student  

### For Methods  

  * Start with lower case.  
  * In mixed case, second word's first letter must be upper case.  
  For example : display(), changeGear(), speedUp(), etc.  

### For Variables  

  * Start with lower case.  
  * In mixed case, second word's first letter must be upper case.  
  For example : age, name, empName, collegeCode, etc.

### For Constant Variable  
 
  * Should all be in upper case with words seperated by '_'(underscore).  
  For example : POSITIVE_INT, NEGATIVE_INT, etc.
