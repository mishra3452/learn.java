# What is java ? 

Java is an object-oriented, cross platform, multi-purpose programming language produced by Sun Microsystems. First released in 1995, it was developed to be a machine independent web technology. It was based on C and C++ syntax to make it easy for programmers from those communities to learn. Since then, it has earned a prominent place in the world of computer programming.   

#### Characteristics of Java  

  * **Platform independence :** Many languages are compatible with only one platform. Java was specifically designed so that it would run on any computer, regardless if it was running Windows, Linux, Mac, Unix or any of the other operating systems.   
  * **Simple and easy to use :** Java's creators tried to design it so code could be written efficiently and easily.  
  * **Multi-functional :** Java can produce many applications from command-line programs to applets to Swing windows (basically, sophisticated graphical user interfaces).   
  * **Robust :** Robust simply means strong. Java uses strong memory management. There are lack of pointers that avoids security problem. There is automatic garbage collection in java. There is exception handling and type checking mechanism in java. All these points makes java robust. But the main areas which Java improved were mishandled Exceptions by introducing automatic Garbage Collector and Exception.  
  * **Secure :** When it comes to security, Java is always the first choice. With Java's secure feature it would enables us to develop virus-free systems.  

## The Java Platform  

One thing that distinguished Java from some other languages is its ability to run the same compiled code across multiple operating systems.  

In other languages, the source code (code that is written by the programmer), is compiled by a compiler into an executable file. This file is in machine language, and is intended for a single operating system/processor combination, so the programmer would have to re-compile the program seperately for each new operating system/processor combination.  

Java is different in that it does not compile the code directly into machine language code. Compilation creates bytecode out of the source code. Bytecode generally looks something like this:  

```
a7 f4 73 5a 1b 92 7d
```  

When the code is run by the user, it is processed by something called the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM).** The JVM is essentially an interpreter for the bytecode. It goes through the bytecode and runs it. There are different versions of the JVM that are compatible with each OS and can run the same code. There is virtually no difference for the end-user, but this makes it a lot easier for programmers doing software development.
